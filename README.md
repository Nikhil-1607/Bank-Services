# Bank-Services
In this era of the pandemic, going to places such as banks, has become an ordeal. Although many services can be done via net banking, even then there are a few services which require the customer to visit the bank for their task to be done. This may be because some identification is required, or because of some security reasons.
As overcrowding is not preferable in such circumstances, and also the formation of queues outside banks seems to be an ordeal, there has to be a solution.
This project is a prototype of what banks (or any other office) may achieve using its database system. The project is a C++ program of what banks may use in an online interface. It can also be integrated with SMS services.
The aim is for customers to be able to book a visit to the bank on a particular day by asking for a token, with a specified time slot, on that very day. The working hours have been specified in the program. Each slot is a 30 min slot and per slot there are 4 (or as per the number of desks available) customers to control crowding. In real life scenarios, such tokens can be messaged or emailed to any customer.
Also, conditions can be made to omit bank holidays, and Sundays. As this is just a prototype, the program has been designed only for the month of August 2021.
As there is no database connected to this project, the user of this project is requested to initialize the associated binary files with the date, starting working hours (9, in this case), minutes (0), and token number (1), when using this program for the first time on a particular date.
The various output pictures show the outputs given by this program under various conditions.
Thank you for reviewing this project, and, hopefully, it is a good prototype of what has become a necessity in todayâ€™s world.
